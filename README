# 🧠 **Project Title: UniMem AI**

**Tagline:** *Empowering AI Agents with Long-Term, Multi-Modal Memory*

---

## 🚩 **Overview**

**UniMem AI** is a multi-modal memory engine that transforms your everyday experiences — text, voice, images, and documents — into an evolving, structured stream of knowledge.
By organizing these “memory units” in a semantic graph, it provides AI agents with long-term recall and reasoning capabilities — enabling them to understand not only what you said, but also what you meant, when, and in what context.

Our goal is to bridge human-like memory and AI cognition: a system that *remembers, relates, and reasons* over time.

## 💡 **Problem**

Most AI assistants today suffer from **short-term memory** — they forget past interactions, lose context, and cannot build on what they previously learned.
Meanwhile, humans continuously process information from **multiple modalities** (conversations, visuals, notes, meetings).
This creates a gap between how humans remember and how AI operates.

### Challenges we address:

* Fragmented data across formats and platforms
* Lack of persistent, contextual memory for AI systems
* Inefficient retrieval and reasoning over personal or team knowledge

---

## 🚀 **Solution**

**UniMem AI** continuously collects and organizes multi-modal inputs into a unified *memory stream*, stored as structured “memory cells” with semantic metadata.
Each memory cell encodes:

* Content embeddings (text, image, audio transcripts)
* Context (time, source, relationships)
* Summaries and keywords

The AI Agent retrieves relevant memory clusters during conversations or reasoning tasks, allowing it to:

* Recall past events, ideas, and visuals
* Draw inferences based on long-term knowledge
* Continuously evolve by consolidating new experiences

This transforms an AI agent from a reactive chatbot into an intelligent, memory-driven companion.
